# Video Embed Test

For work, we were experiencing some issues trying to embed videos on a client's site - the handmade method we were using sometimes didn't load the video, or the play button didn't work, etc. Often, the presence of an ad blocker would actually *fix* the issue.

I used Plyr to handle podcasts on another client's site and decided to try it out with a video. It worked, with or without an ad blocker.

Someone forked this so I am updating to add some notes in case they are helpful.
